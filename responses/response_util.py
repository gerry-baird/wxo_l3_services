Dear Sam Anthony,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding your life insurance policy. It's great that you have taken the step to protect your loved ones in the event of your passing, but have you considered what would happen if you were to become seriously ill?

Many people overlook the importance of critical illness cover, and it's a common misconception that life insurance will cover all eventualities. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Critical illness cover is designed to provide financial support if you are diagnosed with a serious illness, such as cancer, heart attack, or stroke. It can help to cover the costs of medical treatment, rehabilitation, and even everyday expenses like mortgage payments and bills.

At our company, we understand the importance of critical illness cover and want to help our customers be prepared for any eventuality. That's why we are offering a discount on our critical illness cover for customers who have one or more policies with us already. This is a great opportunity to ensure that you and your loved ones are protected in the event of a serious illness, while also saving money on your insurance premiums.

I would be happy to discuss this further with you and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call at a time that suits you.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
